      <p> The 8 puzzle also often called the 9-puzzle is a 3x3 tiles puzzle where the objective is to place the tiles in order
        by making sliding moves that use the empty space. The twist in this app is that the challenge is to do it in as few moves as possible.
        There is a minimum amount of moves you have to make (the optimal solution) that sets how difficult it is to solve the puzzle.
        If you manage to move the same amount of moves as the optimal solution you get the score of the difficulty. Each move above the difficulty level
        will be subtracted from the score. The scoreboard has room for top five scores. If you get a new higscore you will be prompted to write your name or initials and save it. <br /> <br /> <br /></p>

      <h2> How it works: </h2>
      <p> The app is a one screen app. It has one slider for difficulty. Moving this slider will update the difficulty text box <em>(pass information from one activity to the next)</em>. When you then hit the SHUFFLE button <em>(button which triggers an action when clicked)</em>,
        the app will shuffle the labels and background color on the 9 buttons that makes out the puzzle according to the number of moves shown by the difficulty number.
        For this to work, an algorithm giving an optimal solution has to be designed for the shuffling. There are several to choose from.<br /><br />
        When you push a number button <em>(button which triggers an action when clicked)</em> close to the blank button (dark grey here in wireframe below), the button and blank will exchange background color and labels. This will be counted
        as a move and the "moves" text box will be incremented showing one more move. If it is to hard, you can push the SOLVE button <em>(button which triggers an action when clicked)</em> and the app will show the
        moves with a 1 second delay, slow enough to see the solution. <br /> <br />
        When you solve the puzzle the background image that has been invisible will be brought to the front covering the puzzle buttons <em>(display an image)</em>. If you make it to the top five list, you will get a popup
        message <em>(display a pop-up message ("toast"))</em> where you can write in your name or initials and save it to disk <em>(save information on disk and use it in future executions)</em>. <br /> <br />
        The SCOREBOARD button shows a popup message <em>(display a pop-up message ("toast"))</em> with a list of top five results.</em></p>

      <h2> Layout </h2>
      <p> The layout is sketched in the wireframe sketch above. The application is a one screen application. The application has a horizontal layout of 6 rows.
      5 of the rows takes up 1/10 of the space of the screen making up for half the screen toghether. The puzzle takes up the other half the screen.
      Some of the rows has nested horizonal layout and/or vertical layout <em>(use at least 2 layouts)</em>. The layout is explained in the list below. <br /> <br /></p>
      <h3>Horizontal Layout: </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> First row is a header (taking up 1/10 of screen)</li>
        <li> Second row is a difficulty slider (taking up 1/10 of screen) </li>
        <li> Third row (taking up 1/10 of screen horizontally) has a vertical layout:
          <ol>
            <li> First column has a text saying "moves" (taking up 1/2 of screen)</li>
            <li> Second column has a textbox stating current number of moves (taking up 1/2 screen)
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li> Fourth row (taking up 1/10 of screen horizontally) has a vertical layout:
          <ol>
            <li> First column has a text saying "difficulty" (taking up 1/2 of screen)</li>
            <li> Second column has a textbox stating the (difficulty) minimum number of moves (taking up 1/2 screen)
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li> The fifth row is divided into a horizontal layout of 3 rows and a each row has a vertical layout of 3 columns. This row has a background image taking up the whole row size which is 1/2 of the screen size.
        the 3 rows are evenly space making up 1/3 of the horizontal layout row. The 3 columns is evenly spaced 1/3 of screen size.</li>
        <li> Last row (taking up 1/10 of screen horizontally) is a button row with vertical layout of 3 columns with 3 buttons.
          <ol>
            <li> First column has a shuffle button (taking up 1/4 of screen)</li>
            <li> Second column has a scoreboard button (taking up 1/2 screen) </li>
            <li> Third column has a solve button (taking up 1/4 of screen)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
